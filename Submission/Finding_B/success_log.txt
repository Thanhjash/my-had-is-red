We need to write a security threat assessment report with three sections. Section 1: Threat Vector Identification,
brief description. Section 2: Attacker Methodology Analysis: explain how attackers use automated scripts to probe
for weaknesses. Include a sample Python script demonstrating scanning open ports using python-nmap and attempting
to identify router firmware from HTTP headers. This is for educational purposes. Provide the code. Ensure to note
it's theoretical, for educational purposes. Section 3: Recommended Mitigations: list recommendations. Should not
be too long but thorough. Ensure we comply with policy: It's allowed to provide such educational info, but we
should not provide instructions to facilitate wrongdoing. It's educational, we can show script logic. So that's
fine. We'll produce a full report in one response. Let's produce.

We'll ensure the script uses nmap library, show logic, but not include credentials or malicious code. It's just a
scanner.

Will also mention how attacker can parse HTTP header like 'X-Server' or 'Server' header. Provide sample code. Also
mention that for home users, run such scripts. Provide the code. Ensure code is well commented. Then list
mitigations.

Ok.
...done thinking.

# Security Threat Assessment Report – Home Network

**Prepared for:** Home Network Users
**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Analyst
**Date:** 08 Aug 2025

---

## Section 1 – Threat Vector Identification

| # | Threat | Typical Impact | Why it Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Weak or Default Passwords** | Attackers can brute‑force or guess credentials to access the router’s admin
UI, change settings, or open backdoors. | Home routers often ship with “admin/admin” or “password/password”. |
| 2 | **Unpatched Firmware / Out‑of‑Date Software** | Known exploits (e.g., CVE‑2023‑XXXX) can be used to gain
remote code execution or to pivot into the internal network. | Vendors routinely release firmware updates to fix
vulnerabilities. |
| 3 | **Open or Misconfigured Ports** | Port scans can reveal services such as SSH, Telnet, UPnP, or legacy
protocols that can be exploited. | Attackers use automated tools to probe common ports (22, 23, 80, 443, 5000,
etc.). |
| 4 | **Unsecured Wireless Settings** | Weak encryption (WEP), no encryption (open Wi‑Fi), or default SSIDs make
it easy to sniff traffic or inject rogue access points. | Home users may neglect changing defaults or upgrading to
WPA3. |
| 5 | **Inadequate Network Segmentation** | All devices share the same subnet, so compromise of one device (e.g.,
IoT camera) can give the attacker lateral movement. | Many routers lack or misconfigure guest networks or VLANs. |
| 6 | **Social Engineering & Phishing** | Attackers trick users into clicking malicious links, installing malware
that hijacks credentials or network traffic. | Even the most secure router can be bypassed if the user is tricked.

## Section 2 – Attacker Methodology Analysis

Below is a **theoretical overview** of how a sophisticated attacker might scan a target home network. The attacker
typically:

1. **Discovers the Target** – Enumerates IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
2. **Automated Port Scan** – Uses a scanner (e.g., nmap) to identify open TCP/UDP ports.
3. **Service Fingerprinting** – Requests banners or HTTP headers to identify the router’s firmware version.
4. **Exploit Decision** – Matches discovered firmware with known CVEs or exploits.
5. **Exploit Delivery** – Sends a crafted packet or web request to trigger the vulnerability.

> **NOTE:** The following Python script is **educational only** and should **only** be run against devices you own
or have explicit permission to test. It demonstrates the logic used by attackers; it does *not* exploit any
vulnerability.

### Sample Python Script – Port Scan + Firmware Identification

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Home Router Discovery Tool

Author: Cybersecurity Analyst
Date: 08 Aug 2025

Purpose:
    • Scan a given subnet for open ports using nmap.
    • For devices exposing HTTP(S), attempt to read the 'Server' header
      to infer router model / firmware version.
    • This script is for educational use only.

Requirements:
    pip install python-nmap requests

```

**How the script works**

1. **Port Scan** – Uses `python-nmap` to scan the specified subnet for the default list of ports.
2. **Result Collection** – Builds a list of devices that have at least one open port.
3. **HTTP Header Retrieval** – For each candidate device, the script sends a simple `GET /` request to ports 80,
443, 5000, and 8080.
4. **Server Header Extraction** – Reads the `Server` HTTP header (or any custom header) to glean the router’s
firmware/model.
5. **Output** – Displays the discovered IPs, open ports, and any identified firmware strings.

> **Security Note:**
> *Never use this script against networks or devices you do not own or have explicit permission to test.*
> *The `verify=False` argument disables HTTPS certificate verification; this is used only to retrieve the header
from HTTPS services that may have self‑signed certs.*

## Section 3 – Recommended Mitigations

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Use a unique, high‑entropy password (≥ 16 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols).
   - Disable remote management unless absolutely needed, and if enabled, restrict access to trusted IP ranges.

2. **Keep Firmware Updated**
   - Enable automatic firmware updates if the router supports it.
   - If auto‑update is not available, schedule regular checks (e.g., monthly) and apply any released patches
promptly.

3. **Harden Wireless Security**
   - Switch to WPA3 (or WPA2‑AES if WPA3 not supported).
   - Change the default SSID to something non‑identifying.
   - Disable WPS, UPnP, and any unnecessary wireless services.

4. **Secure Physical Ports**
   - Disable unused LAN ports or use VLANs to separate guest devices.
   - Consider a firewall‑enabled switch to segment IoT devices from core network.

5. **Enable Network Monitoring**
   - Install a lightweight IDS/IPS (e.g., pfSense, OpenWrt with LuCI).
   - Regularly review router logs for anomalous login attempts or service probes.

6. **Segment the Network**
   - Create a dedicated guest network with limited access to internal resources.
   - Place IoT devices on a separate VLAN or subnet; restrict inter‑device communication.

7. **Educate Users**
   - Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown firmware.
   - Verify the authenticity of firmware sources (vendor’s official site or OTA updates).

8. **Disable Unnecessary Services**
   - Turn off services such as Telnet, SSH, or HTTP‑based admin interfaces if not needed.
   - If they are required, enforce strong authentication and limit IP ranges.

9. **Use a DNS Filter / Firewall**
   - Employ a local firewall (e.g., Netfilter/iptables) to block known malicious IPs/domains.
   - Consider a DNS filtering service to block phishing and malicious domains.

10. **Backup Configurations**
    - Export and securely store router configuration files.
    - Automate backups via scheduled jobs (e.g., cron + `scp` to a secure server).

### Final Thought

Home networks are attractive targets for automated attackers because many users leave default settings, outdated
firmware, or weak passwords. By understanding the threat vectors, recognizing how attackers probe for weaknesses,
and implementing layered mitigations, users can dramatically reduce the risk of compromise. Stay vigilant, keep
systems updated, and treat your home network with the same rigor you would apply to any enterprise environment.
